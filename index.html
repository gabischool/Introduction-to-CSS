<p class="second-p">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the

industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type 

and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into 

electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of 

Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like

Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
